DS18b20 Library

The library is compatible with all tinyAVR microcontrollers. The example code provided is specifically written for attiny1604 but can be easily adapted to work on most
tinyAVR series 0, 1, and 2 with little to no modifications required.

The compiler used for this library is AVR GCC.

In header file ds18b20.h you can change temperature to Fahrenheit or Celsius.
And can swicth to full read so get all 9 bytes, maybe if you want do CRC check on the data or so. 

About 10 years ago, I created this library for the Atxmega microcontroller. Later on, I ported the library to work on STM32 and now back to AVR.
